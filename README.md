# 📦 My Python Mini Projects

Hi! I'm **Aum**, a first‑year CSE student passionate about coding, learning, and building real projects. 👋

This repository shows my journey from basic Python scripts to cleaner, advanced, and more interactive versions. I started by writing simple CLI programs, then improved them by adding GUIs, better design, emojis, score tracking, and more. To refine them, I used documentation, YouTube tutorials, and AI help (like ChatGPT) — but the project ideas, logic, and structure are my own. 💡

## 🧮 Calculator Projects

### ✅ Calculator.py
- Original text‑based calculator (CLI)
- Supports many operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, square root, exponentiation, modulo, and even unit & currency conversion
- Shows my first attempt at making a multi‑feature CLI tool

### ✅ Calculator_advanced.py
- Improved CLI calculator
- Uses Python's `math` module for advanced operations: sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, pow, abs, max, min, etc.
- Cleaner menu and better input handling

### ✅ Calculator_gui.py
- GUI version built with `tkinter`
- Has number & operator buttons, equals (=) and clear (C)
- Simple design; my first try at adding user interface to Python projects

## 🎮 Game Projects

### ✅ dual_game.py
- Combines two classic games:
  - 🪨📄✂️ Stone Paper Scissors
  - 🐍💧🔫 Snake Water Gun
- User chooses:
  - Which game to play
  - Play vs computer 🤖 or vs friend 👥
- Keeps score, shows emojis, has clean and modular code
- Big upgrade over my old single‑game version

### ✅ the_perfect_guess.py
- Number guessing game
- User chooses difficulty (easy/medium/hard → changes range)
- Tracks number of guesses and keeps best score 🏆
- Gives better hints: "way too high / too low" vs "a bit high / low"
- Handles wrong input gracefully and uses emojis to feel more interactive

## ✅ Why this project matters
I built these projects:
- To learn Python beyond basics
- To explore CLI vs GUI apps
- To practice clean code, functions, input validation, user experience (UX)
- And to show how ideas grow from a first version to an improved one ✨

Even though I used AI as a learning assistant, I designed and understood each part myself — so this is truly *my project*.
